# **General Exclusions**

17. **Publicly known processor Side-Channel Attacks:**  
    17.1 The reason this rule exists is because there is no safe way to test without a special setup. If you have strong reason to believe that an issue may impact our environment, please contact us at [security@digitalocean.com](mailto:security@digitalocean.com) and we'll work with you to set up an environment for safe testing.
18. **Known Vulnerabilities:**

    24.2 You may email us at [security@digitalocean.com](mailto:security@digitalocean.com) to inform us about leaked secrets in credential lists or public databases. While this will not be awarded a bounty payout, we appreciate good faith notices and will investigate your claim.
