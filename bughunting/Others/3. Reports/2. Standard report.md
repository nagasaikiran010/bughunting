Great question ‚Äî when you're submitting to **HackerOne**, **Bugcrowd**, **YesWeHack**, or **Intigriti**, the _first impression_ matters **a lot**. A solid report should be:

- **Structured**
    
- **Clear**
    
- **Reproducible**
    
- **Impactful**
    
- **Professional**
    

Below is a **standardized vulnerability report template** designed to impress triage teams across all major bug bounty platforms ‚Äî especially when reporting a **critical vulnerability** like `/etc/shadow` exposure and successful password cracking.

## üîê Standard Critical Vulnerability Report Template

> üí° Use this on **HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, or YesWeHack**. You can copy and paste this into the platform‚Äôs report form, and customize values where needed.

### üìå Title:

**Critical Information Disclosure: Public Access to `/etc/shadow` & Cracked Passwords via Google Dorking**

---

### üìÇ Asset:

`https://[target.com]`  
_(Update this to the in-scope asset if specified)_

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Vulnerability Type:

- Information Disclosure
    
- Sensitive File Exposure
    
- Credential Exposure / Brute-force Attack
    
- Server Misconfiguration
    

---

### üîç Summary:

A critical vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive system files, including `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`, via public indexing (Google dorking). I was able to extract password hashes from the `/etc/shadow` file and successfully crack them using `hashcat` and the `rockyou.txt` wordlist, resulting in the compromise of valid system credentials.

---

### üöÄ Steps to Reproduce:

1. **Google Dorking (Recon):**  
    Use the following Google dork:
    
    ```
    site:[target.com] inurl:/etc/shadow
    ```
    
2. **Access Exposed Files:**  
    Visit:
    
    - `https://target.com/etc/passwd`
        
    - `https://target.com/etc/shadow`
        
3. **Download Shadow File:**  
    Save the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file.
    
4. **Extract Hashes & Crack Them:**  
    Using `hashcat` and the `rockyou.txt` wordlist:
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 1800 shadow_hashes.txt /path/to/rockyou.txt
    ```
    
5. **Result:**  
    Example of cracked user credential:
    
    ```
    Username: jdoe
    Hash: $6$...
    Password: qwerty123
    ```
    

---

### üß† Impact:

- Unauthorized access to user accounts
    
- Exposure of system-level usernames and hashes
    
- Possible privilege escalation (depending on user role)
    
- High risk of full server compromise
    

This vulnerability directly impacts the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

### üì∑ Evidence:

**Redacted /etc/shadow Snippet:**

```
root:$6$abcd1234$...:19372:0:99999:7:::
jdoe:$6$efgh5678$...:19372:0:99999:7:::
```

**Cracked Credentials Example (hashcat):**

```
jdoe:$6$efgh5678$...:qwerty123
```

_(Full PoC and logs can be provided upon request or are attached below, if permitted.)_

### üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations:

- Restrict access to system files using proper file permissions and server hardening.
    
- Remove public access to `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.
    
- Rotate all compromised credentials immediately.
    
- Implement web server rules (Apache/Nginx) to block access to sensitive paths.
    
- Use a `robots.txt` to prevent indexing of sensitive directories.
    
- Monitor for signs of post-exploitation activity.

Let me know which platform you're submitting to, and I can format the **markdown** exactly how it looks inside HackerOne, Bugcrowd, etc.

Also, if you're targeting a **bonus/impressive submission**, I recommend:

‚úÖ Including screenshots or terminal output  
‚úÖ Highlighting **actual exploitability** (not just theoretical)  
‚úÖ Offering remediation guidance  
‚úÖ Keeping your tone professional & cooperative
