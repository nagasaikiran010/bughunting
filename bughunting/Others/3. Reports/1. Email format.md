Absolutely â€” when submitting a **vulnerability report over email**, especially if the target doesn't have a formal bug bounty platform, you want to keep it **professional, clear, and concise**, while providing just enough technical detail to get their attention and show you're serious.

Hereâ€™s a **perfect format** for emailing a vulnerability report:

---

### âœ… **Email Subject:**

**Security Vulnerability Report for [domain.com] â€“ Critical Exposure (e.g., /etc/shadow)**

---

### âœ… **Email Body:**

```
Hi [Recipient Name or Team],

My name is Nagasaikiran T., and Iâ€™m a security analyst and ethical hacker from India. I recently discovered a critical security vulnerability on your website [insert domain, e.g., www.example.com] through passive reconnaissance (Google dorking).

This issue involves unauthorized access to sensitive system files such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`, which has allowed me to retrieve and crack hashed user credentials using publicly available tools. This poses a serious risk to your server integrity and user data.

Below is a brief summary of the finding:

---

**ðŸ“Œ Affected URL:**  
`https://[domain]/etc/shadow`

**ðŸ“Œ Vulnerability Type:**  
Information Disclosure + Credential Exposure (High/Critical Severity)

**ðŸ“Œ Impact:**  
- Public access to system user data (`/etc/passwd`)
- Public access to password hashes (`/etc/shadow`)
- Successful cracking of passwords using hashcat and `rockyou.txt`

**ðŸ“Œ Risk:**  
- Full system compromise  
- Potential privilege escalation  
- Unauthorized access to accounts or services

---

I have responsibly saved all evidence and am ready to provide the full technical report, including proof-of-concept, reproduction steps, and mitigation advice, if you confirm the preferred method of submission.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
**Nagasaikiran T.**

Would you like me to generate this as a `.eml` or `.txt` draft you can use directly in an email client? Or maybe a shorter version for a more casual contact (like a startup or personal site)?
