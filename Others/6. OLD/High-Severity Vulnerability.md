Seeking Expert Insights on Potential High-Severity Vulnerability 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1:

Exposed ".well-known/openid-configuration" endpoint

I've uncovered a potentially critical vulnerability during a web application test, and I'm reaching out to the community for guidance on exploitation and responsible disclosure.

Key Findings:
  - Exposed ".well-known/openid-configuration" endpoint
  - Access to sensitive OpenID Connect configuration details, including:
  - Issuer
  - Authorization, token, revocation, userinfo, and introspection endpoints
  - JWKS URI
  - Secret keys (kid, sig, n, e) related to RSA and EC

Now as per my knowledge, these are for OAuth2 and related tokens and endpoints

Started reading OAuth2 docs and openID [[openidconnect]] docs but i'm not into development so little difficult for me to exploit same.

I know if i report this as "sensitive information disclosure", they will mark it as medium or low so i need to create a little more impact and the information i have is mostly whole openidconnet secrets 

So i guess i can exploit and report it as "High Severity"

Seeking Assistance:

Exploitation Guidance: I'm not a developer, so I'd appreciate insights on how to effectively exploit this vulnerability to demonstrate its impact.

PART 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After little research about OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect, i guess the file i got is public endpoint and designed to be public

but check following file from file

"id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": [ "none", "HS256", "HS384", "HS512", "RS256", "RS384", "RS512", "ES256", "ES384", "ES512" ],


The presence of "none" in the id_token_signing_alg_values_supported field indicates that the OpenID Connect provider supports unsigned ID tokens. Using an unsigned ID token introduces a security vulnerability known as the "none" algorithm vulnerability.

Impact:
Unsigned ID tokens (algorithm "none") are susceptible to token tampering attacks. An attacker can intercept and modify the ID token, as there is no cryptographic signature to verify the token's integrity. This could lead to unauthorized access, impersonation, and other security risks.

But still confused about "For which token/ authentication endpoint, they are using this openid configuration ?"

Let me know if anyone can help
