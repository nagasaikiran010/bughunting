## 📌 Summary

A [bug type] vulnerability was identified in the `[vulnerable endpoint or parameter]` endpoint that allows an attacker to [brief description of the impact]. This issue affects authenticated users and may expose sensitive functionality or data.

---

## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce

1. Log in as a regular/low-privileged user.
2. Send the following request:

```
    GET /api/user/profile?user_id=1002 HTTP/1.1
    Host: target.com
    Authorization: Bearer <valid_token>
```


3. Modify the `user_id` to a different valid user ID, such as `1001`.
